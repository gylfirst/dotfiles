# My dotfiles for my Arch Linux

> You need a AUR helper in order to setup the dynamic change of wallpapers! (paru or yay)

I use Thunar as File Explorer, so if you use another one, change the config in the `exec-once` of `.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`

## How to install

Clone the repository and go inside:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gylfirst/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

Make the script executable and launch it:

```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```

This should be done!
Enjoy your Arch Linux experience :blush:
